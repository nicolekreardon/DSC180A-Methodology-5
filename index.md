- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered so far in my domain this quarter are the Large Language Time Series Models (Chronos and TTM) that can be incorporated with the different types of indicators that different investors use to determine when to enter and exit markets.

- **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 project is how much market sentiment analysis can predict the direction of a stock. Since stock prices fluctuate for many more reasons than the sentiment of a market, I want to explore roughly to what extent it aids in predicting the price of a stock.

- **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change I'd like to make to the approach in my current Quarter 1 project is learning and expanding into other sectors outside of the EV sector. The type of sector that models are trained on are important as they are less generalizable to other sectors so I would like to see how well our models could work in areas such as the tech industry and others. 

- **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
So far, we have not fully explored how to incorporate market sentiment (from collecting data to using it in LLMs) so I would be interested in exploring it to use in my Quarter 2 project, along with stock price history data for technical and fundamental analysis.
